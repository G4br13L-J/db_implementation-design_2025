# ðŸ“˜ EIF 211 - Database Design and Implementation

This repository contains a collection of **practical evaluations** developed during the course **"EIF 211 - Database Design and Implementation"**.

## ðŸ§  About the Course

Throughout this course, I had the opportunity to explore and learn about **SQL** and its core features as a standardized query language. The activities focused on applying key concepts through hands-on exercises related to database design and manipulation.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

The evaluations in this repository include practice tasks covering:

- ðŸ”¹ **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`.
- ðŸ”¹ **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.
- ðŸ”¹ **Stored procedures**.
- ðŸ”¹ **User-defined functions**.
- ðŸ”¹ **Triggers**.
- ðŸ”¹ **Custom validations and constraints**.
- ðŸ”¹ **Join operations**:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`
  - `RIGHT JOIN`
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`

## ðŸ“Ž Additional Notes

- Scripts are primarily written in **Oracle SQL**, using syntax suited for academic environments.
- Each evaluation is organized in separate folders to improve clarity and navigation.

## ðŸš€ Purpose of the Repository

To share the progress and knowledge gained during the course, as well as to serve as a reference for other students or developers interested in database design and SQL implementation.
